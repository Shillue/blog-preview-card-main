### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS custom properties (variables)

## What I learned

In this project, I reinforced important fundamentals of HTML and CSS, especially layout and responsiveness.

Some key learnings:

- Proper use of **Flexbox** for layout alignment and spacing
- Understanding the difference between `height` and `min-height` when building flexible layouts
- How to center content vertically while keeping the footer at the bottom
- Responsive behavior using media queries
- Writing cleaner and more maintainable CSS

This challenge also helped me practice CSS fundamentals more deeply. I learned how to use CSS custom properties to centralize color management, making the design easier to maintain and update in the future.

## Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue improving:   
- Responsive layout strategies   
- Cleaner CSS architecture   
- Accessibility best practices   
- Transitioning from Flexbox to CSS Grid where appropriate
